"""
FastAPI application entrypoint.

Graph state, the shared httpx client, and the hydration service are created
once at startup (lifespan) and stashed on app.state, so every request
handler shares the same in-memory graph and connection pool.

Run directly with:
    uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5007

(see start.sh for the containerized version)
